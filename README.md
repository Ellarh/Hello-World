# Hello-World
This is my first input and entry into Github.
My name is Emmanuella Ndukwe-Obuikwu, and I'm from Nigeria.
I am an Entry-Level Software developer, whose main focus is on the creation of Augmented Reality applications using the Unity Game Engibe and C# programming language.
I started learning about Augmented reality after reading an article on it and got interested on what this tech is about. I continued my research on Augmented reality, and the more I researched and read, the more fascinating it was and the more interested I became.
I decided to learn how to create Augmented reality experiences using Unity Engine and also how to code with it's primary Language.
Learning Augmented reality development is a life-changing decision for me, because it has opened up a whole new world of possibilities and people for me.
I look forward to seeing what the AR Tech will be and I also look forward to creating more exciting applications and experiences.
